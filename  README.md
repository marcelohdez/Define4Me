# Define4Me

A graphical Java application that finds and outputs the definitions of a given
list of words pasted into it (each line will be considered a new word, to allow
searching for multi-worded phrases such as "deep web"). It uses the MVC design
pattern through the Swing GUI library. The definitions are obtained through
meetDeveloper's [free dictionary API] and parsed with the [Jackson JSON
library].
